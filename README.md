# ReflectNet: Separating Reflection and Transmission Images in the Wild
Patrick Wieschollek, Orazio Gallo, Jinwei Gu, Jan Kautz (ECCV 2018)

Abstract
-------------------
The reflections caused by common semi-reflectors, such as glass windows, can impact the performance of computer vision algorithms.
State-of-the-art methods can remove reflections on synthetic data and in controlled scenarios.
However, they are based on strong assumptions and do not generalize well to real-world images. Contrary to a common misconception, real-world images are challenging even when polarization information is used.
We present **ReflectNet**, a deep learning approach to separate the reflected and the transmitted components of the recorded irradiance that *explicitly* uses the polarization properties of light.
To train it, we introduce an accurate synthetic data generation pipeline, which simulates realistic reflections, including those generated by curved and non-ideal surfaces, non-static scenes, and high-dynamic-range scenes.

The following figure shows a common case and our estimation of the reflection and transmission images compared with state-of-the-art methods.

This repository contains the source code and the model for ReflectNet, our 2018 ECCV paper "Separating Reflection and Transmission Images in the Wild." To compare against existing state-of-the-art, we also implemented several previously published methods, which may be useful to others in the research community. Specifically, in addition to our [ReflectNet](ReflectNet), we offer implementations for:

- [Polarization and statistical analysis of scenes containing a semireflector *(Schechner et al. [1])*](./other_methods/Schechner_et_al)
- [A physically-based approach to reflection separation: From physical modeling to constrained optimization *(Kong et al. [3])*](./other_methods/Kong_et_al)
- [Single Image Reflection Suppression *(Arvanitopoulos et al. [4])*](./other_methods/Arvanitopoulos_et_al)
- [Separating reflections and lighting using independent components analysis *(Farid and Adelson [5])*](./other_methods/Farid_et_al)
